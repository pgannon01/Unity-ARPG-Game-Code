    // This is a scriptable object

    // Definition of scriptable object:
    // A data container that you can use to save large amounts of data, independent of class instances
    // One of the main use cases for ScriptableObjects is to reduce your Projectâ€™s memory usage by avoiding copies of values
    // Every time you instantiate that Prefab, it will get its own copy of that data. 
    // Instead of using the method, and storing duplicated data, you can use a ScriptableObject to store the data and then access it by reference from all of the Prefabs. 
    // This means that there is one copy of the data in memory.
    // Just like MonoBehaviours, ScriptableObjects derive from the base Unity object but, unlike MonoBehaviours, you can not attach a ScriptableObject to a GameObject
    // Instead, you need to save them as Assets in your Project.
